Ocean
=====

Ocean is a smart and powerful application framework and server which uses the KISS principle ("Keep it simple, stupid"). It enables you to develop (distributed) (web or Internet of Things) applications. Therefore, Ocean contains several components to support you:
* A distributed logging component with different loggers (log to console, to a database cluster, admin's web view)
* A public facing webserver
* A private facing webserver (e.g. for administration issues)
* A messaging component called ICCC to communicate with all of your servers (or even with other parts at different programming languages at different servers)
* A template engine for web applications
* A half-automated configuration management
* A simple I18N support
* A simple database abstraction which MongoDB as database back-end
